# Spring-Boot-JPA-Projection
## Understanding JPA Projection in Java Spring Boot
Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, managing, and persisting data between Java objects and a relational database. In the context of Spring Boot applications, JPA is often used to simplify the data access layer. One powerful feature of JPA is projection, which allows you to shape query results to fit specific needs.

What is JPA Projection?
JPA Projection is the ability to retrieve only a subset of attributes from an entity, or even a combination of attributes from multiple entities, in the result set of a query. This can significantly improve performance by fetching only the data needed for a particular use case.
